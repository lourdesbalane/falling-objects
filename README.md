Data Analysis for Physics 192 Falling Objects Experiment

We dropped 3 objects with various masses and radii--small ball (sb), medium ball (mb), and big ball (bb)-- and tracked their positions and velocities using Vernier LabQuest.

Here we analyze the experiment data and compare theoretical vs experimental position and velocity curves using chisquare.
